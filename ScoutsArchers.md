# Scouts to Archers - Build Order

Notes to Remember
- 21 villagers in dark age
- Scout actively
    - Search for enemy gold and woodlines
    - Use scouts to keep enemy off gold if they are trying to fast castle
- Constantly build villagers in fuedal age until clicking wheelbarrow and then castle

## DARK AGE
1. 6 to sheep
2. 3 to wood
3. 1 to fetch boar
4. 1 more to sheep/boar
5. 4 to berries (first one builds two houses first)
6. 2 to boar => transition 2 from under the town center to farms
7. Rest to wood (Up to 22 pop)(build second lumber camp when 5 villagers are already working your first)
8. Research Loom
9. Click Feudal

## TRANSITION TO FEUDAL

1. Move three from boar/sheep to wood so 5 and 5 are on each lumber camp (5 on sheep, 10 on wood, 4 on berries, 2 on farms)
2. Build Barracks & house

## FEUDAL AGE
1. Build Stable w/ at least 2 villagers => start creating scouts immediately
2. Research Double Axe and Horse Collar immediately
3. Transition new villagers and sheep villagers to wood and then farm around town center until you have 14 farms (18 on food)
4. Get 10 on gold (2 from berries, 8 new)
5. Research Bloodlines => Attack the enemy
6. Build two Archery Ranges when wood is available, and start producing Archers non-stop (researching gold mining is a good idea)
7. Research Wheelbarrow
8. Build Blacksmith => Research Fletching
9. Click Castle => should have at least 10 archers, with fletching. (12 on wood, 18 farms, 10 on gold) ~40 villagers total

# Scouts to Archers - Civilizations
Not every Age civ is great at scout rushing, some don't even have scouts. Here are some of the best civs for this build order, as well as some other civs who are good at the strategy. Typically you wouldn't focus on a scout rush if your civ lacks Bloodlines; however, since your switching to archers, strong archer oriented civs who lack Bloodlines can still execute this strategy well enough.

1. Magyars
2. Mongols
3. Huns
4. Franks
5. Slavs
6. Indians
7. Britons (No Bloodlines, but strong Archer followup)
8. Vietnamese (No Bloodlines, but strong Archer followup)
